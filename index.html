        <h2 id="home">About Cats</h2>
        <p>This website was made to teach people how to take care about their cats. Cats are seen as really easy animals to take care of and sometimes 
            it sounds like people think they will just take care of themselves. That is not the case. You need to du a lot of things with your cat. Playing, 
            emptying the litter box, giving attention, making sure they are healthy, taking care of their coat, their teeth and their claws are all part of 
            taking care of your cat. On this page you will get information on how to do some of these things. <br>
            If there is anything you think would be good to discuss here or you have a question, please e-mail questions@aboutcats.eu . <br><br>
            Any questions about your cat’s health will be answered with some general information and the advice to contact your veterinarian. If you think 
            your cat is in pain or ill, please contact your veterinarian immediatly for professional advice. Better safe than sorry.
            </p>

        <h2>Claws</h2>
        <p>First of all I would like to make sure you all know the difference between clipping a cat’s claws and declawing your cat. When you clip 
            the claws of a cat, it is like when you cut your nails. On the other hand, declawing your cat means you cut their fingers off at the first joint. 
            Declawing your cat causes health issues and your cat will be in pain due to it. Clipping their claws does not.
            Depending on whether you have and indoor or an outdoor cat, you might need to clip your cat’s claws. We clip their claws in order to make 
            sure the nail doesn’t get too long. An outdoor cat will grind their claws down so much that they stay short enough. That means you don’t have to 
            clip their nails. Indoor cats do not grind their claws down as much, so if you have an indoor cat you need to clip their claws. 
            <br>Make sure you don’t take off too much, since cats have blood vessels in their claws. You can see them as a darker line inside the claw. 
            If you can’t see it, cut a tiny bit off at a time.
            </p>
        <h2>Coat</h2>
        <p>Cats shed (if you have a cat with hair, that is), which means it’s a good idea to brush them during shedding season. If you do, your cat will 
            end up swallowing less hair while grooming themself. That means less hair balls to clean up. You also get less hair laying around in your home 
            if you brush your cat. It’s also important to brush long haired cats regularly to avoid matting.
            <br/>When it comes to brushing, the best way to go about it is to just let the cat do the grooming. You might need to bath senior cats when they start 
            having problems reaching all parts of their body. Cats who have peed or pooped while traveling might also need help cleaning themselves up
        </p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>All cats are carnivores. That means they eat meat. The difference between carnivores and omnivores is that omnivores (for example humans) eat everything, 
            while carnivores (for example cats) only eat meat. That means they can´t survive without eating meat. 
            Another thing that is important to know is what cats can and cannot eat. Even though they are carnivores, cats are prone to taste the leaves of house 
            plants. Make sure you dont have any plants that can harm your cat. You can find a link with more information here.
            When you are choosing food for your cat there are a few things to think about. Is the quality good? Is this food for kittens, neutered cats or for 
            elderly cats? Cats need different kinds of food at different stages of their life to live as healthy of a life as possible. Also remember neutered 
            cats gain weight easier than cats that still have functioning reproductive systems. Indoor cats also have a huge tendency to gain weight if you are not careful. 
            <br>OBS! Follow the recommendations on the packaging for your cat food when it comes to portion size. And always listen to your veterinarian’s 
            advice when it comes to food.

        <h2>Q&A</h2>
        <p>Q: I just adopted a second cat and need to introduce her to my other cat. How do I do that in a good way? <br>
            A: I would recommend you to check out Jackson Galaxy’s youtube video on cat introductions. It is a step by step guide on how to introduce your cat to a new furry family member. 
            <br><br>
            Q: I just got a kitten, and I’m wondering if I should castrate him. <br>
            A: Yes, you should castrate your cat. There are already too many homeless cats, and we don't need to bring more of them into the world. Neutering your cat also makes them less prone to pee in other places than in their litter box. They also don't have the sexually drive that might lead to them getting out of the house to mate. Generally it is much better for the cat and for you. 
            <br><br>
            Q: I’m thinking about getting a cat, but I’m worried that my partner or I might be allergic. What can I do to figure it out? <br>
            A: A good way to know if you are allergic is to get a pillowcase and have a cat lay on it. Then you and your partner sleep on the pillow case. If you have an allergic reaction to the pillow case you shouldn’t get a cat. If you dont feel anything you should be good to go. Just remember this is not a foolproof test.
