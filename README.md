# About cats
When people adopt cats it can sometimes seem a bit daunting to learn the most important parts in caring for a cat. That’s when “About Cats” comes into the picture. The website is meant to be a source of important information to new and old cat owners. Have you for example adopted a second cat and don’t know how to introduce them to the old cat? Just send in a question or check if the question has already been answered in the Q&A section. Or you might be wondering if you need to clip your outdoor cat’s claw. Then all you need to do is check the Care section of the website. This is a site for all the basic knowledge you need to care for a cat.

## Features

### Navigation bar

- The different buttons link to different topics on the page.
- The round picture links to the top of the page.

### Topic images:
- One image for every topic.
- Separate the sections.
- Background image visible at the top of the page.

### Main section:
- Different information about cats.
- Topics separated by images.
- Q&A section.

### Footer:
- Contact information.
- Links to social media (opens in new tab).
- Copyright information.

## Features left to implement:
- Might want to add a form for sending in questions.
- Other than that I just want to add more information to the page, since it’s meant to be a simple page for getting information.
## Testing
Tested all features on many different screen sizes. Also tried it on my phone with no problems. The page looks best on mobile, but looks and works well on every screen size. All features work as intended regardless of screen size and/or device. The navigation is easy to understand on all screen sizes.
(insert picture of “amIResponsive” and mobile screenshots)

The background did show more the smaller the screen gets. I adressed this with my media querries. Depending on the screen size, the top margin for the main page changes. This way the background looks good regardless of screen size.

### Validator testing
- Tested HTML in the W3C validator. Returned no errors.
- Tested CSS in the official Jigsaw validator. Found no errors.

### Unfixed bugs
- The "home button" links to the first paragraph, which means that when you click on it the background picture doesn't show. This has not been adressed yet due to the fact that i havn't decided how i want to adress it.

### Deployment
This site was deployed to github pages.
- Open repository setting.
- Go to "pages" (found under "code and automation").
- Choose which branch to build from (main).
- (If needed, choose a custom domain)

## Credits
### Content
- The code for the css grid was taken from one of my old projects (https://github.com/bus0211/wu2Bprojekt2020). Project from a web development course in socondary school. The reason it is forked from another user (my teacher) is that he wanted to have easy acces to the whole class' projects.
- The icons in the footer was taken from Fontawesome (Link facebook icon: https://fontawesome.com/search?q=facebook&s=solid%2Cbrands Link instagram icon: https://fontawesome.com/icons/instagram?s=brands)

### Media
- All pictures used are either taken by me or a friend (he has given me permission to use the pictures on this website. Name: Robin Koelewijn).
- Robin Koelewijn has taken the topic image for the Q&A, and the image above the footer.
