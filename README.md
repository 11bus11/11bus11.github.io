# About cats
When people adopt cats it can sometimes seem a bit daunting to learn the most important parts in caring for a cat. That’s when “About Cats” comes into the picture. The website is meant to be a source of important information to new and old cat owners. Have you for example adopted a second cat and don’t know how to introduce them to the old cat? Just send in a question or check if the question has already been answered in the Q&A section. Or you might be wondering if you need to clip your outdoor cat’s claw. Then all you need to do is check the Care section of the website. This is a site for all the basic knowledge you need to care for a cat. 
# Existing features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
