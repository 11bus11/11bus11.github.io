        <h3>Claws</h3>
        <p>First of all I would like to make sure you all know the difference between clipping a cat’s claws and declawing your cat. When you clip 
            the claws of a cat, it is like when you cut your nails. On the other hand, declawing your cat means you cut their fingers off at the first joint. 
            Declawing your cat causes health issues and your cat will be in pain due to it. Clipping their claws does not.
            Depending on whether you have and indoor or an outdoor cat, you might need to clip your cat’s claws. We clip their claws in order to make 
            sure the nail doesn’t get too long. An outdoor cat will grind their claws down so much that they stay short enough. That means you don’t have to 
            clip their nails. Indoor cats do not grind their claws down as much, so if you have an indoor cat you need to clip their claws. 
            <br>Make sure you don’t take off too much, since cats have blood vessels in their claws. You can see them as a darker line inside the claw. 
            If you can’t see it, cut a tiny bit off at a time.

        <h3>Coat</h3>
        <p>Cats shed (if you have a cat with hair, that is), which means it’s a good idea to brush them during shedding season. If you do, your cat will 
            end up swallowing less hair while grooming themself. That means less hair balls to clean up. You also get less hair laying around in your home 
            if you brush your cat. It’s also important to brush long haired cats regularly to avoid matting.
            <br/>When it comes to brushing, the best way to go about it is to just let the cat do the grooming. You might need to bath senior cats when they start 
            having problems reaching all parts of their body. Cats who have peed or pooped while traveling might also need help cleaning themselves up
